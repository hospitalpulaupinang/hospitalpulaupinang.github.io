             In  her  opening  speech,  Dato’  Dr  Norsidah  pointed  out  that  based  on  international
        statistics,  one  out  of  five  patients  that  undergo  surgery  will  continue  to  have  pain  even
        though the physical wound has healed. Therefore, access to immediate and effective pain
        treatment is pivotal as it can improve a patient’s quality of life and reduce cost in terms of
        treating patients with chronic pain.

             An  exhibition  was  also  held  at  Foyer  B  throughout  the  week  to  raise  awareness
        amongst healthcare providers and for the public concerning post-surgical pain management.
        A patient information brochure (A patient’s guide to management of pain after surgery)
        was made available for all.

               Patient  safety  is  a  key  dimension  of  quality  in  health  care  and
          should be given prime importance by the healthcare fraternity. If possible,
          preventable adverse events should be avoided, at all cost. There are 13
          patient safety goals monitored to in HPP.
