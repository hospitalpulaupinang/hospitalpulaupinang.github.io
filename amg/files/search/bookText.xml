                   I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all contributors and reviewers
            of the first edition Hospital Pulau Pinang Antimicrobial Guideline (HPP AMG) 2018.
            The  writing  group  has  taken  great  effort  in  compiling  and  drawing  up  the  most
            appropriate antimicrobial therapy for each systemic infection taking into consideration
            of our own hospital antibiogram and clinicians’ preference guided by evidence-based
            medicine.


                   In the report of the National Surveillance on Antimicrobial Utilization 2017, HPP
            was one of the 5 hospitals with the highest prescriptions of cephalosporins, especially
                  th
            the 4  generation cephalosporin and carbapenems. The utilization of these antibiotics
            continues to rise between the months of January to June 2018 as highlighted in the recent
            Infection Control Meeting 3/2018. The utilization of IV vancomycin increased by 40
            %, IV imipenem/cilastatin increased 21%, IV meropenem increased 13% and IV colistin
            increased 25%. The rise in the rates of Multi Drug Resistant (MDR ) organisms eg.

            Extended  Spectrum  Beta  Lactamases  (ESBL)  Klebsiella  pneumoniae,  ESBL  E.coli,
            Carbapenem  Resistant  Enterobacteriaceae  (CRE)  and  Carbapenem  Resistant
            Acinetobacter baumannii in this hospital is worrying to all clinicians.

                   This guideline aims to provide effective and appropriate treatment options for
            common  infections  presenting  to  HPP.  It  encourages  the  use  of  narrow  spectrum
            antibiotics in mild to moderate infections but does not restrict broad spectrum antibiotics

            in  more  severe  infections.  Antimicrobial  audit  will  be  carried  out  yearly  in  Point
            Prevalence Study 2.0 from Ministry of Health in the month of October. It is imperative
            to document the indication of initiating antimicrobial in the patient’s note clearly and a
            review of the need to either de-escalate, stop or continue therapy must be done 48-72
            hours after initiation. This guideline will be used in the audit for appropriateness of

            therapy.

                   I sincerely hope that all the clinicians in HPP will  give their support for this
            guideline in the management of infections in order to reduce inappropriate antimicrobial
            prescription.

            Thank you.

                   Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is increasing and is now a global public health
            threat. Infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant micro-organisms are associated with
            increased morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Inappropriate and non-judicious
            use of antimicrobials is associated with the emergence of AMR.




                   Recognizing the urgent need for an antibiotic guideline in Hospital Pulau Pinang
            (HPP),  a  group  of  adult  and  paediatric  infectious  disease  physicians,  clinical
            microbiologists and pharmacists have reviewed multiple international guidelines and
            our  own  Malaysia  National  Antimicrobial  Guideline  (NAG)  2014.  This  hospital
            antibiogram for past one year was also analysed in order to create an evidence based
            guideline for the use in HPP. We are thankful to all the Head of Departments who had
            given their expert opinions on the draft and agreed on the content. I am honoured to

            introduce the first edition HPP antimicrobial guideline 2018 which will be launched in
            conjunction with the World Antibiotic Awareness Week Campaign in our hospital.



                   It is estimated that 30- 40% of hospital antimicrobial use is inappropriate. With
            this guideline, we sincerely hope that all clinicians in HPP will adopt and support the

            use of it by prescribing antimicrobial according to what is stated in the document. In the
            future, any antimicrobial audit can be done as we have our own guideline for reference.
            This  guideline  will  be  updated  on  a  regular  basis  taking  into  the  consideration  the
            changing antibiogram and cost effectiveness of treatment.



            Thank you.

               1.  This guideline is designed to guide empirical and targeted antimicrobial selection.

               2.  Escalation  or de-escalation  of antimicrobial  agents must be considered after reviewing the
                   culture results.

               3.  Switching  to  oral  antimicrobial  agents  is  strongly  recommended  when  patient  clinically
                   improved and able to take oral medicine.

               4.  Duration of therapy suggested in this guideline might not represent the true requirement for
                   every patient.  Clinical correlation is important.

               5.  The dosage  of antimicrobial suggested in this guideline is based on normal renal function.
                   Please refer to appendix 1 for dosage adjustment in renal impairment.

               6.  Please refer to appendix 2 for alternative therapy in penicillin allergy.

               7.  Please refer to National Tuberculosis Guideline as the chapter for anti TB has been excluded
                   in this guideline.

               8.  Best practice in antibiotic care bundle includes:
                       a.  Start antibiotics ONLY if there is clinical evidence of bacterial infection.

                       b.  Documentation in patient note and medical chart is important:
                              i.  Treatment indication
                              ii.  Drug name, dose, frequency and route
                             iii.  Treatment duration (or review date)

                       c.  Obtain appropriate cultures before starting antibiotics.

                       d.  Ensure the antibiotics are given within 4 hours of prescription.
                              i.  Within 1 hour for severe sepsis or neutropenic sepsis.

                       e.  At 48- 72 hours after starting antibiotics, make an antimicrobial prescribing decision:
                              i.  Review the clinical diagnosis
                              ii.  Review laboratory/ radiological results
                             iii.  Modify the antibiotic prescribing options:
                                     1.  Stop antibiotic if no evidence of bacterial infection
                                     2.  Switch to oral therapy if clinically stable
                                     3.  Change antibiotic according to culture result
                                     4.  Continue current antibiotic and determine duration of therapy

                   1.  It is the use of antibiotics to prevent infections at the surgical site.

                   2.  The optimal time for administration is within 60 minutes before surgical incision.

                   3.  Giving more than 1 or 2 doses post-operatively is generally not advised.

                   4.  The practice of continuing prophylactic antibiotic until surgical drain removal is NOT RECOMMENDED.

                   5.  A second dose may be required in the following situations:

                          a.  Delay in start of surgery.
                          b.  Prolonged operations when the time is more than 2 half-life of the usual dosing interval of the antibiotic.
                          c.  Excessive bleeding (more than 1.5L) intra-operatively.

                   6.  Consider doubling the dose if BMI > 35.

                   7.  Some agents, such as clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, gentamicin, metronidazole and vancomycin require administration over
                       1-2 hours; therefore, administration of these agents should begin within 120 minutes before surgical incision.

                   regurgitation

               Dental procedures for which prophylaxis is recommended

               All dental procedures involve manipulation of gingival tissue or the periapical region of teeth or perforation of gingival mucosa.

               Other procedures for which prophylaxis is recommended

               Antibiotic prophylaxis may be given to high risk patients who undergo invasive procedure:
               •  Procedures of respiratory tract that involve incision or biopsy of the respiratory mucosa
               •  GI or GU procedures in patients with ongoing GI or GU tract infection

                   1.  Any infection in the immunocompromised host is life-threatening and needs immediate attention.

                   2.  Febrile neutropenia is defined as a temperature of >38.3 C on a single occasion or >38 C over one hour and ANC
                          (Absolute Neutrophil Count) <500cells/uL or <1000cells/uL in those with anticipated declining counts.

                   4.  Patients have impaired inflammatory responses and hence may have no localizing signs. The usual sign is fever>38 C or
                       hypothermia.

                   5.  The common portals of infection include the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, perianal region, lungs and IV lines.

                   6.  Potential pathogens are dependent on the underlying defect, e.g.

                        Neutropenia                                           Gram –ve organisms, gram +ve organisms, fungi

                   7.  The choice of antibiotic is based on local organisms and sensitivity patterns. The clinical state of the patient, prior infections
                       with drug resistant bacteria, recent outbreaks e.g. MRSA or multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae, as well as the availability
                       and cost of the antibiotics.

               Infective Endocarditis

               IE prophylaxis recommended for patients with the highest risk cardiac conditions undergoing procedures likely to result in bacteraemia with a microorganism
               that has the potential ability to cause bacterial endocarditis

               For highest risk procedures:
               • Dental procedures that involve manipulation of either gingival tissue or the periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa; this does not include
                 routine dental cleaning.
               • Procedures of the respiratory tract that involve incision or biopsy of the respiratory mucosa
               • Procedures in patients with ongoing gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU) tract infection
               • Procedures on infected skin, skin structure, or musculoskeletal tissue
               • Surgery to place prosthetic heart valves or prosthetic intravascular or intracardiac materials

               Genitourinary or gastrointestinal procedures:
               IE prophylaxis only if ongoing GI or GU tract infection. Require activity against enterococci (amoxicillin or ampicillin) or vancomycin for penicillin allergic

               Maintenance of optimal oral hygiene may reduce the incidence of bacteraemia from daily activities and is more important than prophylactic antibiotics for a
               dental procedure to reduce the risk of IE.



                                                                          Suggested Treatment

 Infective Endocarditis

 IE prophylaxis recommended for patients with the highest risk cardiac conditions undergoing procedures likely to result in bacteraemia with a microorganism
 that has the potential ability to cause bacterial endocarditis

 For highest risk procedures:
 • Dental procedures that involve manipulation of either gingival tissue or the periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa; this does not include
 routine dental cleaning.
 • Procedures of the respiratory tract that involve incision or biopsy of the respiratory mucosa
 • Procedures in patients with ongoing gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU) tract infection
 • Procedures on infected skin, skin structure, or musculoskeletal tissue
 • Surgery to place prosthetic heart valves or prosthetic intravascular or intracardiac materials

 Genitourinary or gastrointestinal procedures:
 IE prophylaxis only if ongoing GI or GU tract infection. Require activity against enterococci (amoxicillin or ampicillin) or vancomycin for penicillin allergic

 Maintenance of optimal oral hygiene may reduce the incidence of bacteraemia from daily activities and is more important than prophylactic antibiotics for a
 dental procedure to reduce the risk of IE.

 For passive PEP
 Susceptible hosts include

 •  Immunocompromised children and adults who lack evidence of immunity to VZV
 •  New-borns of mothers with varicella shortly before or after delivery (i.e. 5 days before to 2 days after delivery)
 •  Premature infants born at ≥28 weeks of gestation who are exposed during their hospitalization and whose mothers do not have evidence of
 immunity
 •  Premature infants born at <28 weeks of gestation or who weigh ≤1000 g at birth and were exposed during their hospitalization, regardless
 of their mothers' evidence of immunity to varicella
